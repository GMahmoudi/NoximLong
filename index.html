      <p># NoximLong: NoC-Long-Connections Simulator<br>
       ### -based on Noxim - the NoC Simulator-            </p>

<p>Welcome to NoximLong, the Network-on-Chip Simulator which supports long connections between mesh nodes.
NoximLong is developed at the Department of Communication and Electronic Engineering, Faculty of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, University of Tishreen (Syria) .</p>

<p>NoximLong is based on <a href="https://github.com/davidepatti/noxim">Noxim, the NoC Simulator</a>, developed at the University of Catania (Italy).</p>

<p>As Noxim, the NoximLong simulator is developed using SystemC, a system description language based on C++, and
it can be downloaded from SourceForge under GPL license terms.</p>

<p>Similar to Noxim, NoximLong has a command line interface for defining several parameters of a NoC.</p>

<p>NoximLong extends the capabilities of Noxim by supporting the simulation of long connections between the mesh nodes.
Long connections are not foreseen by Noxim, which is designed to simulate the regular mesh networks on chip.</p>

<p>The long connections can be defined between pairs of nodes. The nodes are idintified by their IDs.</p>
