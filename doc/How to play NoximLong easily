#To run noximLong you can use the noxim parameters, as in the following example

./noximlong -dimx 6 -dimy 6 -routing xy -verbose 2 -warmup 20 -sim 200

#To simulate long connections using noximLong you have to define a long connections file (see the example file longConn_Example.txt)
#then use the parameter -longconn as following:

./noximlong -dimx 6 -dimy 6 -longconn LongConn_Example.txt -routing xy_simple5 -verbose 2 -warmup 20 -sim 200

#Note: it is important to specify a suitable routing algorithm that makes use of the long connections.
#NoximLong defines two such routing algorithms: xy_naiv5 and xy_simple5
#Other algorithms can be also implemented.
