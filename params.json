The nodes are idintified by their IDs.\r\n\r\nFor further informations please refer to the following files contained in the \"doc\" directory:\r\n\r\n- INSTALL.txt: instructions to install the tool\r\n- MANUAL.txt: explanation of the arguments that can be passed to the simulator\r\n- AUTHORS.txt: authors of the tool\r\n- LICENSE.txt: license under which you are allowed to use the source files\r\n\r\nIf you use NoximLong in your research, we would appreciate the following citation in any publications to which it has contributed:\r\n\r\nG.
